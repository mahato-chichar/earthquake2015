                <h3>Preface</h3><br>
                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">The earthquakes of 25 April and 12 May 2015 are the most unforgettable natural shocks to the present generations of Nepal that took thousands of human lives and damaged a large number of residential and government buildings, cultural heritages, schools, health facilities and other infrastructures. After the earthquake occured, the Government formed multi-sectoral committees to assess the extent and impact of damage and carried out Post Disaster Needs Assessment(PDNA) to identify resources required to building back better. The assessment categorized 31 districts of the country as earthquake affected with 14 districts classified as the most affected for which urgent attention and action was needed.</p><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">This <q>Household Registration for Housing Reconstruction Program</q> is a survey of residential households in the affected districts that dealt with comprehensive engineering assessment of the residential buildings and collection of socio-economic data of the respective households by qualified and specially trained engineers. The survey was felt urgent when the government decided to provide some assistance to the affected and needy households in a view to encourage them to build more earthquake resistant structures at a time when there was no baseline database to identify the beneficiaries. Therefore, for this purpose in mind and as per request from the National Reconstruction Authority(NRA) and the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development(MoFALD), Central Bureau of Statistics(CBS) conducted the survey with the support of various governmental and non-governmental partner organizations.</p><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">The whole survey in 31 districts has been accomplished in three phases. In the first phase, 11 of the most affected districts namely <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dolakha, Ramechhap, Okhaldhunga, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Sindhuli, Makawanpur, Dhading, Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Gorakha</span> were completed covering all the households. In the second phase, the three districts of Kathmandu Valley, viz. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur</span>, which were also categorized as the most affected districts, were done using Verification Method in which the engineers visited only those households which were enlisted by the local village and district authorities as earthquake affected households. The same Verification Method was applied to carry out the survey in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Solukhumbu, Shankhuwasabha, Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Khotang, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Arghakhanchi, Palpa, Gulmi, Syangja, Parbat, Baglung, Myagdi, Kaski, Tanahun, and Lamjung</span> disricts which were classified as less affected 17 districts by the government. </p><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">I would like to thank National Reconstruction Authority(NRA) and Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development(MoFALD) for entrusting CBS to carry out this crucial task.  I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to all the members of the steering and technical committees, whose timely direction and guidance helped us to accomplish the task on time. Also, I would like to acknowledge the hard-work and devotion of all memebrs of Central Technical Task Force (CTTF) set up in the CBS who worked day-and-night throughout the survey period to accomplish the mission on time. This survey would not have been successfully completed without the diligent and efficient performance of CTTF to manage the survey in all technical aspects including questionnaire design, training, survey management, supervision and monitoring, data management, micro-data preparation, tabulation of data and report writing. Likewise, the CBS officers who shouldered the responsibility of Interlocutor Officers in the survey districts and members of District Survey Management Team for the overall management and execution of the survey activities in the field.  Also, I would like to acknowledge the support and contribution of Chief District Officers (CDO), Local Development Officer (LDO) and other members of district survey coordination committees in survey districts. I highly appreciate the hard work and sincerity shown by the survey engineers who visited door-to-door to assess the extent of building damage and collect key socio-economic information related to the affected households. Also, I would like to thank all social mobilizers who supported and facilitated the engineers at the local level in completing the survey successfully. Likewise, I would also like to thank the World Bank for their generous financial support and engagement during the first and second phases of the survey in 14 districts and the Department for International Development (DFID), UK for supporting and financing the survey in 17 districts. Similarly, I highly appreciate the role of UNOPS Nepal in managing logistics support and human resources throughout the survey. Finally, I am very much indebted to all the households in the affected districts who participated in the survey and cooperated the survey team in providing their truthful information. </p><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">It is my great pleasure to announce that CBS has now accomplished the task successfully and releasing the anonymized micro-data set with a statistical summary report to the public. The report contains key findings of the surveys with some basic statistical tables generated from the micro-data of the survey. The first part of the report contains key findings of the survey in 14 most affected districts whereas second part of the report contains key findings of survey in 17 affected districts.  I hope that, this data set will be useful as baseline disaster data of the affected areas which will open windows of opportunities for planning and executing reconstruction related programs and further research in those areas. </p><br>

                <p style="margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">I would like to encourage all the academia, professionals and experts for the optimum use of this data set to come up with better solutions to frame useful policies and programs for the recovery and reconstruction of the affected areas. Any suggestions and feedbacks related to the report and the data set will highly be appreciated. </p><br>
