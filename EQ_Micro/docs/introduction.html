                <h3>1 Introduction </h3>
                <p>The devastating 7.6 Richter Scale earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25, 2015 noon and its aftershocks mostly affected 31 districts. The quake took a large number of human and animal lives causing massive damage to the buildings and infrastructure in 14 most affected districts namely <span> Dolakha, Ramechhap, Okhaldhunga, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Sindhuli, Makawanpur, Dhading, Nuwakot, Rasuwa, Gorakha, Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur and inflicted minor damage in 17 less affected districts namely Solukhumbu, Shankhuwasabha, Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Khotang, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Arghakhanchi, Palpa, Gulmi, Syangja, Parbat, Baglung, Myagdi, Kaski, Tanahun, and Lamjung </span>disricts. The Government successfully carried out instant relief and rescue operation by coordinating national and international well-wishers' hand and cooperation. The government also completed Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) in about a month after the quake which assessed the level and extent of damage in the national level and helped the government to garner international support in the future reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.</p>

                <h3>2 Earthquake Affected Housing Survey</h3>
                <p>The PDNA sufficiently provided quick and summary assessment of the total damage but it did not have the detail information necessary to provide individual assistance to housing reconstruction. A detailed and comprehensive household survey to identify beneficiaries of the housing support was also a precondition of some of the development partners including the World Bank to ensure transparency while providing grants. Therefore, the government decided to conduct this earthquake affected housing survey in order to identify beneficiaries to receive the support.</p>
                
                <h3>2.1 Organizational set up of the Survey</h3>
                <p>The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has been entrusted by the government to take the overall responsibility of the survey. The CBS formed a high-level steering committee under the chairmanship of member-secretary of National Planning Commission which provided the overall policy guidance to the survey. A technical committee under the chairmanship of the director general of the CBS was formed to deal with the technical matters. The technical committee also comprised of representatives from relevant government ministries and development partners including the World Bank and JICA. A Central Technical Task Force (CTTF) headed by deputy-director-general of CBS was formed to support the technical committee. The CTTF supported all the technical matters like central level planning, preparing questionnaires and manuals, conducting and managing for training and monitoring and supervision. A number of sub committees headed by the Directors (namely: Administration and Field management Committee, Monitoring and Quality Control Committee, Training and Logistics Management Committee, Data Management Committee, Planning and Budgeting Committee) were formed to work intensively on those aspects required for the survey. </p>

                <p>The survey was completed in three phases; the 11 of the 14 most affected districts outside the Kathmandu valley in the first phase; the 3 districts of Kathmandu valley in the second phase and 17 less affected districts in the third phase. A District Survey Management Office(DSMO) was set up in each of the survey districts and an Interlocutor Officers (Director or Statistical Officer) was deputed from CBS to this office for the overall management and execution of the survey activities in the field. In all of the districts, a survey coordination committee headed by Chief District Officer (CDO) was formed who played coordinating role as required by the survey. Similarly, the Local Development Officers (LDO) of the respected districts acted as adviser to the survey activities.</p>

                <h3>2.2 Questionnaire and Manuals </h3>
                <p>The questionnaire used in the survey was prepared through a wide consultation with the stakeholders and deliberation in the CTTF and technical committee. The questionnaire consists of two parts; one consisting of building information and the other consisting of socio-economic information of the occupant households. The guidelines prepared by the ministry of urban development which has utilized European Macro-Seismic Scale were used while designing the building questionnaire. Similarly, the guidelines used in population census and other socio-economic surveys used by CBS were used for the socio-economic part of the survey.</p>

                <h3>2.3 Methodology of the survey</h3>
                <p>Census model was used in the in 11 districts and rural areas of Lalitpur district whereas verification model was used in the municipal areas of Kathmandu valley and 17 districts. In the census model, irrespective of the extent of damage, each and every private residential building was visited and assessed. But verification model was used in the municipal areas of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur districts and 17 districts in which the households enlisted and certified by the local village and municipal authorities as earthquake affected households were only visited and assessed. The use of already existed list significantly reduced the amount of survey work and hence time. </p>

                <p>In the survey, private residential houses were visited and assessed by trained surveyors. Irrespective of the ownership of the land or the houses built on such land, the damage level of the houses were assessed as long as they were used or built for residential purposes. </p> 

                <p>The government did an assessment of the non-residential buildings like schools, hospitals and health posts in a separate move during PDNA.</p>

                <h3>2.4 Recruitment of the survey team</h3>
                <p>The survey team was comprised of two persons – an engineer and a social mobilizer. The surveyor engineers were contracted for a period of 2 months of which 45 days were set aside for the field work and 15 days were set aside for training and travel. The engineers played the key leading role in the building assessment and individual interview while the social mobilizers facilitated the overall data collection. The survey mobilized 2632 surveyor engineers including supervisors and nearly an equal number of social mobilizers. The surveyor engineers were recruited and provided by local manpower suppliers under an agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services, Nepal (UNOPS, Nepal). On the other hand, social mobilizers working locally with MoFALD in the village development committees and municipalities were utilized in the survey.</p>

                <h3>2.5 Procurement and Logistics Management</h3>
                <p>Procurement and management of the logistics required for the survey was done by the UNOPS. For the field work, an engineer was provided with a TABLET (a hand-held computer), with at least two extra power-banks, to record the information obtained from the assessment of the building and interview with the respondent. Similarly, they were also provided with a survey kit bag containing a sleeping bag, umbrella, water bottle, measuring tape, torch light, pencil and diary, etc. The printing of hard copy questionnaire for back-up, enumeration manuals, supervision forms, data collection receipt voucher distributed to the enumerated households, ID cards for the surveyor engineers, etc. were also managed by UNOPS. The UNOPS also managed the delivery of required survey materials to the district survey management offices. </p>

                <h3>2.6 Training </h3>
                <p>Various levels of training were organized in the center and districts. A five-days master training of trainers (MToT) was organized at CBS in which 40 persons consisting of senior engineers of Ministry of Urban Development(MoUD), members of CTTF and senior statisticians of CBS. The members of CTTF and senior engineers from ministry of urban development who were directly involved in the questionnaire and manual preparation were employed as the resource persons for the MToT. These persons from the MToT were used as resource persons in the five-days surveyor engineers training that were conducted in Kathmandu in a number of phases as required. This training consisted of four-days of extensive class sessions, mock and peer interview, and case study and one day of field work and discussion. The logistics and venue management for the training was done by the local suppliers hired by UNOPS. </p>

                <p>The district survey management office in the survey districts conducted three-days training for social mobilizers selected to accompany the surveyor engineers in the survey.</p>

                <h3>2.7 Pilot test</h3>
                <p>The paper questionnaire was tested in Sankhu village of Kathmandut in which about 50 households were interviewed. After some modifications after the field test, a draft version of CAPI was prepared and a two-day pilot test was carried out in about 150 households of the Ravi Opi village development committee of Kavrepalanchok district in which the flow of the questions in the CAPI, data transfer to the server and its management, and other aspects of field management like time and HR management were tested. </p>

                <h3>2.8 Data Management </h3>
                <p>Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) was used for the first time in the history of data collection by CBS. The CAPI application to be used in the TABLET for data collection was prepared by a local software developer contracted by UNOPS. The application was prepared by using ODK (Open Data Kit) platform. Such data collected in the field was sent instantly to the central server of CBS housed at Government Integrated Data Center (GIDC) through the mobile network in the TABLET or WIFI. </p>

                <h3>2.9 Field work</h3>
                <p>The District Survey Management Office (DSMO) established in each of 31 districts shouldered the overall responsibility of planning, implementing and managing all the local activities of the survey. </p>

                <p>The DSMO provided each of the survey team with a specified job (designated area or list of households) which was to be completed in the given time. </p>

                <p>The DSMO also conducted the local level awareness programs and information campaign for the survey. Besides, the DSMO also managed for local level coordination and support for the survey.</p>

                <h3>2.10 Communication</h3>
                <p>Various means of communications were used before and during the data collection. Pamphlet and frequently asked questions (FAQ) covering the different aspects of the survey were prepared and distributed to every households. Short visual clips covering the key messages were prepared in Nepali, Newari and Tamang languages employing some comedian actors and aired in national television channels. In addition, short informative audio messages were aired in local FM radios in the districts during the survey period. Likewise, a number of interactions and interviews were arranged in FM and televisions that provided sufficient information to the public regarding the survey.</p>

                <h3>2.11 Quality Control</h3>
                <p>Every possible measure to enhance the quality of survey was adopted during different phases of the survey. In this respect, coordination of all the relevant stakeholders were ensured during questionnaire design. Similarly, check programs were built in the system of CAPI to deal with inconsistency in the answers provided by the respondents and any mistakes inadvertently creeped into the system during the recording of the answers. This resulted in significant increment of quality of the collected data. Two 24-hour help desk for the survey team at CBS were established during the survey which provided appropriate direction to the surveyors. In addition, a toll-free number was also set up at CBS during the period of field work. Similarly, the data uploaded at the server from the field were constantly monitored using trained civil/structural engineers and appropriate instructions were given to the surveyors through telephone in case of any inconsistent data upload.</p>

                <h3>2.12 Supervision and Monitoring</h3>
                <p>Appropriate mechanisms were set up in the center and districts for effective supervision and monitoring of the survey activities. The members of the steering and technical committee, and CTTF team members were extensively mobilized from the center for supervision and monitoring of the training, field work and data management. The coordination committee formed in the district in the chairmanship of the chief district officer and the district survey management office members supervised the field work as well. </p>

                <p>The data management team at the center also monitored the data online and gave appropriate instructions to the surveyors in the field.</p>

                <h3>2.13 Tabulation and Statistical Analysis of Data</h3>
                <p>The data processing and analysis of this survey took relatively much shorter time as compared to other paper and pen based surveys of CBS. The data management team at CBS had to daily carry out tabulation of the data uploaded at the server. The “FLAT” data that was downloaded from the server was first converted to “csv” format and it was imported to STATA and SPSS for further analysis. </p>

                <p>The final cleaned data set was transferred to Department of Civil Registration, MoFALD and appropriate access mechanisms were set up for NRA to use them timely.</p>

                <h3>2.14 Limitations</h3>
                <p>The present National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) was not in existence and therefore it was not clear for the government as to what targeting strategies and beneficiary identifying criteria would be used when survey was finalized and the final questionnaire was approved. </p>

                <p>The survey has provided detailed information on the extent and level of damage to the building and some basic information for its occupants. The building information in most of the cases is as observed and assessed by the surveyor while the socio-economic information is as reported by the respondents. Since we could not enforce seeking any legal documents to enroll in the survey, their truthfulness also relies on the trust of respondents.</p>

                <p>Regarding the building damage information, we have tried to make the assessment as objective as possible by introducing detailed international assessment criteria in the questionnaire. Therefore, we encourage the users to use these scientific criteria wherever possible to determine the overall damage level and grade of the building. </p>

                <h3>2.15 Challenges </h3>
                <p>The first phase of collection of hosing damage information was started nearly after 8 months of the earthquake while it was after 24 months in some districts in the last phase. Some of the had already built and some had repaired their property when we visited there but some were still staying in their temporary shelters waiting anxiously for any kind of support for their building construction. So, it was really a challenge and a sensitive task to ask the victim the same painful situation. </p>

                <p>The other challenge was completing it as quickly as possible. Therefore, CAPI was introduced to reduce the data processing time. An uninterrupted usable internet connection in the field was a must for this. This was ensured by appropriate coordination with the national Internet Service Providers. But due to the formidable terrain and lacking infrastructure in the remote areas of the country, we still had to face connectivity problem in the field. As a result, as some of the surveyors could not upload their data timely due to this problem, they had to repeat the fieldwork as their devices were broken and the data could not be recovered.</p>

                <p>Similarly, conducting trainings for nearly 2500 surveyor engineers in short time was also very challenging. But this was managed very well by securing sufficient resource persons from various partners.  </p>

                <h3>2.16 Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Given that Nepal is very prone to various kinds of natural disasters, especially earthquake, a permanent institution that works on disaster data base and statistics is recommended to be formed. Similarly, the culture of sharing of information among various stakeholders is also to be nurtured. </p>
